# Week 16 Homework:

## Studygroup Assignment(s)
1. [Local Weather - Part 2](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/local-weather):  Add more tickets to your github project and write some code.

## Individual Assignment(s)
1. OPTIONAL:  Buy a Domain Name.  I recommend [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) because they are easy to use, inexpensive, and have good support if you need it.
